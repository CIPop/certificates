# Certificates

This repository contains certificate generation examples for _development_ purposes.
For production purposes the use of a Hardware Security Module is strongly recommended. Private keys should be stored within the HSM instead of the file system.

## CFSSL

To install CFSSL on Ubuntu:

`sudo apt install golang-cfssl`
